    <p><b>Vikings</b> <mark>is the modern name</mark> given to seafaring people primarily from Scandinavia (present-day
        Denmark,
        Norway and Sweden), who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded and settled
        throughout parts of Europe. They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and
        North America. In some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking
        Age, and the term "Viking" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as a collective
        whole. The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles,
        France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.</p>
    <p>Expert sailors and navigators aboard their characteristic longships, Vikings established Norse settlements and
        governments in the British Isles, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, the Baltic coast,
        and along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes in what is now European Russia, Belarus[11] and Ukraine,[12] where
        they were also known as Varangians. The Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus' people, Faroese and Icelanders emerged from
        these Norse colonies. The Vikings also voyaged to Constantinople, Iran,[13] and Arabia.[14] They were the first
        Europeans to reach North America, briefly settling in Newfoundland (Vinland). While spreading Norse culture to
        foreign lands, they simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines and foreign cultural influences to
        Scandinavia, profoundly influencing the genetic[15] and historical development of both. During the Viking Age
        the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three larger kingdoms: Denmark,
        Norway and Sweden.

        <u>The Vikings spoke Old Norse</u> and made inscriptions in runes. For most of the period they followed the Old
        Norse
        religion, but later became Christians. The Vikings had their own laws, art and architecture. Most Vikings were
        also farmers, fishermen, craftsmen and traders. Popular conceptions of the Vikings often strongly differ from
        the complex, advanced civilisation of the Norsemen that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A
        romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; this developed and became
        widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival.[16][17] Perceived views of the Vikings as violent,
        piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that
        had taken shape by the early 20th century. Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on
        cultural clichés and stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy. These representations
        are rarely accurate—for example, there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets, a costume element that
        first appeared in Wagnerian opera.

    <h3><b>Viking Age</b></h3>
    The Viking Age in Scandinavian history is taken to have been the period from the earliest recorded raids by Norsemen
    in 793 until the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Vikings used the Norwegian Sea and Baltic Sea for sea routes to
    the south.

    The Normans were descendants of those Vikings who had been given feudal overlordship of areas in northern France,
    namely the Duchy of Normandy, in the 10th century. In that respect, descendants of the Vikings continued to have an
    influence in northern Europe. Likewise, King Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, had Danish
    ancestors. Two Vikings even ascended to the throne of England, with Sweyn Forkbeard claiming the English throne in
    1013 until 1014 and his son Cnut the Great being king of England between 1016 and 1035.

    Geographically, the Viking Age covered Scandinavian lands (modern Denmark, Norway and Sweden), as well as
    territories under North Germanic dominance, mainly the Danelaw, including Scandinavian York, the administrative
    centre of the remains of the Kingdom of Northumbria, parts of Mercia, and East Anglia.[68] Viking navigators opened
    the road to new lands to the north, west and east, resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the
    Shetland, Orkney, and Faroe Islands; Iceland; Greenland; and L'Anse aux Meadows, a short-lived settlement in
    Newfoundland, circa 1000.[70] The Greenland settlement was established around 980, during the Medieval Warm Period,
    and its demise by the mid-15th century may have been partly due to climate change.The Viking Rurik dynasty took
    control of territories in Slavic and Finnic-dominated areas of Eastern Europe; they annexed Kiev in 882 to serve as
    the capital of the Kievan Rus'.

    As early as 839, when Swedish emissaries are first known to have visited Byzantium, Scandinavians served as
    mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire. In the late 10th century, a new unit of the imperial bodyguard
    formed. Traditionally containing large numbers of Scandinavians, it was known as the Varangian Guard. The word
    Varangian may have originated in Old Norse, but in Slavic and Greek it could refer either to Scandinavians or
    Franks. In these years, Swedish men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval
    Swedish law, Västgötalagen, from Västergötland declared no one could inherit while staying in "Greece"—the then
    Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire—to stop the emigration, especially as two other European courts
    simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians: Kievan Rus' c. 980–1060 and London 1018–1066 (the Þingalið).

    <p>The most important primary sources on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the
        Vikings were active.[129] Writing in Latin letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are
        few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.[130] The
        Scandinavians did write inscriptions in runes, but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary
        documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by
        authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.</p>
    <p>The Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardised alphabet, called runor, built upon
        sound values. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones
        with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not
        necessarily placed at graves. The use of runor survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin
        alphabet.</p>
    <p>The last known people to use the Runic alphabet were an isolated group of people known as the Elfdalians, that
        lived in the locality of Älvdalen in the Swedish province of Dalarna. They spoke the language of Elfdalian, the
        language unique to Älvdalen. The Elfdalian language differentiates itself from the other Scandinavian languages
        as it evolved much closer to Old Norse. The people of Älvdalen stopped using runes as late as the 1920s. Usage
        of runes therefore survived longer in Älvdalen than anywhere else in the world.[156] The last known record of
        the Elfdalian Runes is from 1929; they are a variant of the Dalecarlian runes, runic inscriptions that were also
        found in Dalarna.

        Traditionally regarded as a Swedish dialect,[157] but by several criteria closer related to West Scandinavian
        dialects,[158] Elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility.[159][160][161]
        Although there is no mutual intelligibility, due to schools and public administration in Älvdalen being
        conducted in Swedish, native speakers are bilingual and speak Swedish at a native level. Residents in the area
        who speak only Swedish as their sole native language, neither speaking nor understanding Elfdalian, are also
        common. Älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century. Today there are
        about 2,000-3000 native speakers of Elfdalian.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Knowledge about the arms and armour of the Viking age is based on archaeological finds, pictorial representation,
        and to some extent on the accounts in the Norse sagas and Norse laws recorded in the 13th century. According to
        custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them at all times. These
        arms indicated a Viking's social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet, shield, mail
        shirt, and sword. However, swords were rarely used in battle, probably not sturdy enough for combat and most
        likely only used as symbolic or decorative items.[233][234]

        A typical bóndi (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a seax as a
        utility knife and side-arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to
        be considered less "honourable" than melee weapons. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of
        axes as a main battle weapon. The Húscarls, the elite guard of King Cnut (and later of King Harold II) were
        armed with two-handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease.


        The warfare and violence of the Vikings were often motivated and fuelled by their beliefs in Norse religion,
        focusing on Thor and Odin, the gods of war and death.[235][236] In combat, it is believed that the Vikings
        sometimes engaged in a disordered style of frenetic, furious fighting known as berserkergang, leading them to be
        termed berserkers. Such tactics may have been deployed intentionally by shock troops, and the berserk-state may
        have been induced through ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, such as the hallucinogenic
        mushrooms, Amanita muscaria,[237] or large amounts of alcohol.[238]</p>

    <h4>Medieval perceptions</h4>
    <p>In England the Viking Age began dramatically on 8 June 793 when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on the island of
        Lindisfarne. The devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the
        Viking presence. "Never before has such an atrocity been seen," declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of
        York.[252] Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no
        explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the "Wrath of
        God".[253] More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne demonised perception of the Vikings for
        the next twelve centuries. Not until the 1890s did scholars outside Scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the
        achievements of the Vikings, recognizing their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.[254]</p>
    <h4>Post-medieval perceptions</h4>
    <p>Early modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g.
        Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (History of the northern people) of Olaus Magnus (1555), and the first
        edition of the 13th-century Gesta Danorum (Deeds of the Danes), by Saxo Grammaticus, in 1514. The pace of
        publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's Edda
        Islandorum of 1665).

        In Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and the Swede Olaus Rudbeck used
        runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the
        study of the Vikings was George Hickes, who published his Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus (Dictionary
        of the Old Northern Languages) in 1703–05. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland
        and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in
        original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.

        The word "viking" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by Erik Gustaf Geijer in his poem,
        The Viking. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis
        in historical fact. The renewed interest of Romanticism in the Old North had contemporary political
        implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent.
        Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegnér, a member of
        the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna, which became widely popular in
        the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.


        Viking long ships besieging Paris in 845, 19th century portrayal
        Fascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called Viking revival in the late 18th and 19th
        centuries as a branch of Romantic nationalism. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany
        "Wagnerian" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries Scandinavism. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions
        of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking
        past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. The
        new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to grapple with the primary Icelandic
        sagas.[255]

        Until recently, the history of the Viking Age was largely based on Icelandic sagas, the history of the Danes
        written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Russian Primary Chronicle, and Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib. Few scholars still
        accept these texts as reliable sources, as historians now rely more on archaeology and numismatics, disciplines
        that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period.[256][citation needed]</p>
